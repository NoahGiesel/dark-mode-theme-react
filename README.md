# Getting Started with Create React App

<b>useDarkTheme.js</b> is our custom hook to import where it is needed. 

<b>App.js</b> is (in this case) our target. 

<b>App.css</b> in body we declare our colors as variable (to make things more scalable), adding our custom .dark-mode class with accent colors when switching to dark mode .

 
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
